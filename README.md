# HandwrittenOCR Frontend

## ‚ú® Introduction
This is the frontend application for **HandwrittenOCR**, a web-based Optical Character Recognition system. It allows users to upload handwritten images and receive extracted text in return, including words, full sentences, and alphanumeric strings (e.g., `ADjh90K7`).

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), this frontend interfaces with a backend API (Laravel or Flask) for processing and OCR prediction.
